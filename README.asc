== Introduction

Many entities are currently implementing a series of actions to facilitate the recovery of the productive activity of those businesses and entities, in a safe and secure way.

One of thiese actions is the testing for detection of virus to the employees. Anothe such action is the usage of self-declarations to facilitate employee mobility, or responsibly declare that the business is following all the recomendations of the heath authorities, required to gain again the confidence of the customers.

Even though these credentials are very simple in their format and data content, the urgency in implementation is promoting the usage of different data models which will make very difficult the future interoperability among all solutions currently being implemented.

The objective of this repository is the urgent definition of a common data model for the most important credentials. The effort required is very low, but the potential future benefits are big.
